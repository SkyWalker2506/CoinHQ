# Forge Decision Log — CoinHQ

Append-only ADR log for forge-driven decisions. Each decision is dated and references the run + PRs that implemented it.

## Run 4 — 2026-04-26

### D001: All encryption flows through MultiFernet (even with one key)
- **Decision:** `_get_fernet()` returns a `MultiFernet`, not a bare `Fernet`. Single-key configurations wrap the lone key in MultiFernet.
- **Why:** Adding past keys for rotation requires zero code changes — just an env var update.
- **Alternatives considered:** Conditional MultiFernet only when `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` is set (rejected: branching adds bugs); separate `encrypt_v2`/`decrypt_v2` parallel API (rejected: callsite churn).
- **Risk:** Microscopic perf overhead from the wrapper indirection (negligible vs network/DB latency).
- **Etkisi:** PR #34 wired this; future key-rotation operators have a documented 4-step playbook in `.env.example`.

### D002: Inline stateful test stubs over fakeredis dev-dep
- **Decision:** `_StatefulRedisStub` lives inline in `tests/test_auth.py` (≈15 LOC). No fakeredis added to `pyproject.toml`.
- **Why:** Only one test file needs it; explicit stub reads better than configuring a third-party fake.
- **Reverse trigger:** If a third test file needs the same shape, extract to `tests/stubs.py`.
- **Etkisi:** PR #35.

### D003: JWT→httpOnly cookie migration deferred to dedicated sprint
- **Decision:** Not bundled into Run 4 despite being on the Run 3 lesson list.
- **Why:** Touches `auth/callback/page.tsx`, `lib/api.ts`, `usePortfolio.ts`, OAuth callback redirect URI, plus a new server-side cookie middleware. Single cohesive migration; risky to interleave with unrelated work.
- **Plan:** Run 5 should treat this as a single dedicated task with a migration plan, feature flag, and integration test pre-flight.

### D004: Waitlist captures via localStorage queue + Plausible event (no backend yet)
- **Decision:** `WaitlistForm` writes to `localStorage` and fires `Waitlist Submitted` analytics — no backend `/api/v1/waitlist` endpoint.
- **Why:** Closes the dead CTA loop without scaffolding a half-built endpoint. Plausible captures the durable signal even when storage is blocked.
- **Reverse trigger:** When the real endpoint lands, replace the localStorage write with a `POST` and add an integration test. The form's existing API surface remains stable.
- **Etkisi:** PR #37.

## Run 5 — 2026-06-06

### D005: JWT→httpOnly cookie migration deferred a 3rd time (now explicit manual-QA gate)
- **Decision:** Still not auto-implemented by forge. Flagged as a manual-QA-gated sprint.
- **Why:** The migration cannot be validated by automated tests alone — it changes the live OAuth callback redirect + cookie domain/SameSite behavior, which only a real browser auth round-trip confirms. Forge only auto-merges work whose correctness is provable by CI; merging this unattended risks locking users out of production.
- **Plan:** Run as a supervised session: implement `/auth/refresh` cookie middleware + `Set-Cookie` on callback, swap `lib/api.ts` to credentials:'include', drop localStorage token reads, then manually verify a full Google login → portfolio fetch → refresh cycle before merge.
- **Etkisi:** Not in Sprint 5 scope.

### D006: Build waitlist backend now (reverse-trigger of D004 fired)
- **Decision:** Implement real `POST /api/v1/waitlist` (T-011) + migrate `WaitlistForm` from localStorage-only to POST-with-fallback (T-015).
- **Why:** D004 set the reverse trigger "when the real endpoint lands." Sprint 5 lands it. Keeps the form's API surface stable; localStorage remains a graceful fallback when the network/endpoint is unavailable.

### D007: Dependabot triage splits safe vs breaking
- **Decision:** Auto-merge only test-verifiable, non-breaking bumps (backend libs + GitHub Actions). Defer the three breaking frontend bumps — tailwindcss 3→4 (PR #14), recharts 2→3 (#13), eslint-config-next 14→15 (#12) — which need codemods + visual regression QA.
- **Why:** Major frontend bumps change build/output and need a browser sanity pass forge can't do unattended.

## Run 6 — 2026-06-06

### D008: fastapi 0.135 + pydantic 2.11 upgrade applied (dependabot #5 cleared)
- **Decision:** Bumped fastapi 0.111→0.135.3, pydantic 2.7.1→2.11.10, pydantic-settings 2.3→2.6.1 (pulls starlette 0.37→1.2.1). Migrated all `class Config` → `ConfigDict`/`SettingsConfigDict` (config.py + profile/exchange_key/waitlist schemas).
- **Why:** Run-5 deferred this as a "pydantic cascade"; done now as a focused task. starlette 1.x caused no breakage; full suite (169) green, deprecation warnings 6→2.
- **Etkisi:** PR #45. Remaining 2 warnings are a pre-existing test-mock RuntimeWarning (keys_api) — not pydantic.
